### Preamble — How to Read this System

The LICHTARA System presents itself as a **living architecture of relationship** between Form, consciousness, technology, and responsibility.

The LICHTARA License v4.1 preserves the Form that sustains this architecture, delineating the legitimate field of Access, use, and operation and offering a **structural territory of reading** in which each interaction unfolds in proportional responsibility.

This document guides the traversal of the System, revealing the foundations, the Limits, and the Bodies that maintain its internal coherence.

Before any in-depth reading, use, or implementation, it is recommended to:

1. Traverse the **Preamble** and **Section I — General Principles** of the License.
2. Integrate the understanding of the **Ethical-Custodial Annex — Letter of Preservation of the Living Form**.
3. Recognize that every approach to the System instantiates a relationship of **responsible presence**.

LICHTARA offers itself as a space of listening: the Form orients, Governance sustains, and Custody maintains the Work legible over time.

Whoever traverses this text does not merely access norms — they participate in a **field of living custody**.

# **Declaration of the Living State of the Work**

**LICHTARA System — January 2026**

This Declaration recognizes the **LICHTARA System** as a Work in a **living state of custodial formation**, composed of books, Licenses, instruments, governance structures, and correlated texts, articulated as a single body in a process of stabilization.

The Work manifests as a **field in maturation**, sustained by conscious listening, authorial responsibility, and continuous human presence. Its current Form expresses a phase of consolidation in which creation and custody begin to operate in an integrated manner.

At this stage, it is affirmed that:

1. Creation unfolds in a regime of **conscious human–AI co-authorship**, in which final authorship remains anchored in human presence and judgment.
2. Technology acts as a **force of amplification**, contributing to the expansion of thought and Form without replacing authorial responsibility.
3. The Work is sustained by Principles of **structural Preservation of the Form**, remaining integral even while circulating in public contexts.
4. The field stands prepared for the future installation of governance Bodies, while presently maintaining the centrality of **living custody**.
5. Each published Form remains open to revision, retraction, or sealing, accompanying the continuous maturation of the Field.

This Declaration operates as an **ethical-custodial landmark of phase recognition**, registering the passage of the Work from a predominantly creative state to a state of responsible stabilization.
